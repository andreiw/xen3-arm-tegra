Xen3 ARMv7/Tegra2 work.
=======================

This is a an effort to bring up Samsung's Xen3 tree on
Tegra2. It's meant as a stepping stone to the Xen4 port.
Or maybe not. We'll see.

Status
======

Interrupts and timer working. A "boot volume" passed by the
bootloader (CPIO archive, *cough*, initrd) are expected to
contain /dom0 and /initrd0, which constitute dom0 kernel
and initrd, respectively.

There are rudimentary beginnings of a FIQ-based debugger which
currently just prints PC/cPSR/mode.

Next up:
0) Making the FIQ debugger more useful.
1) Slashing and burning existing dom0 loading code.
2) Attempting to load some dummy kernels and seeing the existing
   switching code work or not.

Building
========

$ make menuconfig
$ make

Running
=======

Assuming you have a Xoom with the serial port through the headphone h^Hjack.

$ sudo fastboot boot  /home/andreiw/src/xen3-arm-tegra/dist/install/boot/xen-bin-3.0.2-2 

This is the current output:
ATAG    (P): 0x00000100
Linked  (V): 0xff008000
Actual  (P): 0x00a00800
Desired (P): 0x00108000

Handing off to C...

Changelog (more or less)
========================
Mar-24-2012: FIQ debugger beginnings, refactored out UART.
Mar-19-2012: Boot volume stuff and xensetup.c cleanup.
Mar-14-2012: Timer and delay working.
Mar-06-2012: GIC/legacy IC stuff in (except for IRQ path),
             timer work - unfinished. Fix HIGH_VECTORS
             and NR_IRQs. Remove unmaintained crud.
Mar-05-2012: Wire GIC and legacy IC stuff.
Mar-02-2012: First work since summer, fixed mm bugs.
Jun-23-2011: Initial commit.

TODO
====

Here goes various stuff that consitutes braindead design
that came from Samsung's EmbeddedXen, and various odds and
ends and which need some lovin', but not immediately.
1) Instead of placing pgd 16K below load address, put it
   after the loaded image.
2) EmbeddedXen put the IVT at PHYS_OFFSET (another 16k
   below pgd, really). I fixed that nonsense by using
   a heap page, but that seems wasteful - just use
   an existing kernel page and map it again.
3) Think about frame table location. Currently after
   kernel image.
4) Fix the link address being 0x8000 - with pgd moved
   should have no reason for this nonsense.
5) Fix percpu to support SMP.

Nice to have:
1) tegrafb for debugging
2) GDB stubs
3) Control of GPIOs to reset, blink leds, etc. More
   for debugging, although by the time I get to a PV
   kernel, a sanitized view on GPIOs will need to be
   exposed via a hypercall.
